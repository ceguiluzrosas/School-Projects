Cool Projects for COMP360

NBC = Naive Bayes Classifier (Spam vs Non-Spam)
- NBC_main: gathers data from txt files, runs NBC_methods, and tests program
- NBC_method: back-end work for program; utlizes "bag of words" model for determining appropriate tag

MCMC = Markcov Chain Monte Carlo (Crytanalysis on Substitution Cypher)
- MCMC_main: quantifies English langauge with "war_and_peace.txt", gathers statistics via bigrams, generates decryption keys, and unravels encryption with the key that has the highest quality score
- You can test this project by typing ```python3 MCMC/MCMC_main.py``` from the command line. Enjoy :)
